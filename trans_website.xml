    <string name="web__sect_how_text"><![CDATA[
<p>Oversec constantly monitors the text on your screen. When it finds an encrypted text, it tries to decrypt it and then shows the decrypted text as an overlay in place of the encrypted text.</p>
<p>In order to encrypt a text, Oversec shows a button next to an active input field. After having entered the secret text, tapping that button makes Oversec read the text, encrypt it and put back the encrypted text into the field. It is now ready to be sent in the subjacent app as usual - the app doesn't even know that it is sending encrypted data!</p>
<p>Oversec also features a unique way of encoding encrypted messages. It stores the encrypted text in invisible (zero-width) characters and let's you add decoy text at the end. That way, a message will just show e.g. "The sun is shining today!" with no visible sign of any encryption, whereas in reality it contains a hidden encrypted message.</p>
<p>You may also encrypt and send photos through Oversec - its unique camera mode even allows you to take and send an encrypted photo without ever storing the original photo on the device.</p>
